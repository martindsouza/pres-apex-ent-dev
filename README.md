# APEX and the Future of Enterprise Development

## Abstract
Development teams can easily get tied down with slow moving development cycles. Slow processes make it very difficult to keep up to date with rapidly evolving technology which can significantly affect a business’ ability to grow. Thankfully for organizations that use Oracle, they can leverage APEX: a web based rapid application development (RAD) tool. By using APEX, organizations can move into the the “IT fast lane” and quickly develop applications for their business needs.

This presentation will highlight how APEX can be used to rapidly develop enterprise applications and leverage different web based technologies to help reduce development time and improve user experience.
